# GraphBin
GraphBin is a metagenomic contig binning tool that makes use of the contig connectivity information from the assembly graph to bin contigs. It utilizes the binning result of an existing binning tool and a label propagation algorithm to correct mis-binned contigs and predict the labels of contigs which are discarded due to short length.
